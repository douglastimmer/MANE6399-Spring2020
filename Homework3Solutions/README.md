## Homework 3 Assignment: Simple Linear Regression

### Assigned: February 6, 2020
### Due: February 14, 2020

Your third homework assignment focuses on Simple Linear Regression. Please download the the GitHub repository and work on your local computer. Once completed, please commit the changes and push your local repository back to the master repository.

Your Homework 3 Repository should contain the following files: train.csv, HomeworkThree.ipynb, and README.md (this file).

The first cell of the Jupyter Notebook is a Markdown cell that contains the title information for this assignment. Please edit the third heading and enter your name. The second cell is a code cell that contains code to load the data, describe the data and plot the data.

---

#### Problem 1, Cell 3

Enter the necessary Python code to fit a simple linear regression model using the Statsmodel library.

#### Problem 2, Cell 4

Cell 4 is a Markdown cell for your interpretation of the results from cell 3. Please include a statement that specifies if the y-intercept and slope terms are statistically significan for this model.

#### Problem 3, Cell 5

Enter the necessary Python to construct and plot standardized residuals in cell 5.

#### Problem 4, Cell 6

Cell 6 is a Markdown cell for you to interpet the results from cell 5 and determine if the linear regression model assumptions are satisfied.

#### Problem 5, Cell 7

Enter the necessary Python code to construct a normal probability plot of the residuals.

#### Problem 6, Cell 8

Cell 8 is a Markdown cell for you to interpret the normal probability plot created in cell 7. Make sure to state whether you believe that the residuals are normally distributed or not normally distributed and why.

#### Problem 7, Cell 9

Enter the necessary Python code to perform Cook's Distance analysis.

#### Problem 8, Cell 10

Cell 10 is a Markdown cell for your interpretation of Cook's Distance analysis conducted in cell nine. Are any observations influential? If so, identify those observation or observations that are influential.

#### Problem 9, Cell 11

Enter the Python code to perform an analysis of DFFITS.

#### Problem 10, Cell 12

Cell 12 is a Markdown cell for your interpretation of the DFFITS analysis performed in cell 11. Once again, determine if there are any influential data points in the data set. If so, identify the observation(s) that are influential.
