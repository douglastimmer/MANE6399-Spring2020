#### Problem 1, cell 3

Enter the Python code to conduct an affinity propagation analysis.

#### Problem 2, cell 4

Using the provided Markdown cell, interpret the output from cell 3 and suggest how many clusters should be used.

#### Problem 3, cell 5

Enter the Python code to conduct an agglomerative clustering analysis using the number of
clusters from problem 2  and construct a dendogram. 

#### Problem 4, cell 6

Using the provided Markdown cell, explain if it is  possible to see the clusters in the dendogram?

#### Problem 6, cell 7

Enter the Python code to conduct a k-means cluster analysis using the number of clusters found in  problem 2.

#### Problem 7, cell 8

Enter the Python code to conduct a HDBSCAN analysis.

#### Problem 8, cell 9

Use the provided Markdown cell to identify the number of clusters and cluster
labels found in problem 7.

#### Problem 9, cell 10

Comment on the similarities and difference in clusters found using affinity propagation analysis, agglomerative clustering, k-means clustering, and HDBSCAN clustering.
